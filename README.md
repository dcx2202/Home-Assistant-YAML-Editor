## Description

We were given the task of developing a YAML graphical editor for the Home Assistant platform, in order to facilitate its use. The project will focus on manipulating configuration files in order to reduce the difficulties many users face when they have to handle textual files (especially when there are multiple files).

With this in mind, our goal was to develop a system that ensures extensibility and adaptability to new requirements, both functional and non-functional. For this reason, it was necessary to find an architecture that allows for easy scalability and extensibility of the editor.
